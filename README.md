Coding assessment for Stage 2 Imarticus Hackathon

The data that was given was of an iris-modified dataset and we needed to find the model with the best accuracy.

As per the trial and error process of various models ,the Random Forest Classifier gives the best accuracy when compared with various other models like K-Nearest Neighbour(KNN), Suport Vector Machine(SVM),etc.
